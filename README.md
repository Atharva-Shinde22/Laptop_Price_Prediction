# Features
Company: This categorical feature represents the laptop manufacturer. It includes renowned brands in the tech industry, influencing pricing based on brand reputation, quality, and market positioning.

TypeName: The laptop's type or category is represented by this categorical feature. It categorizes laptops into various types, such as Notebooks, Ultrabooks, and Gaming laptops, influencing pricing based on the target audience and specific use cases.

Cpu: The Central Processing Unit (CPU) of the laptop is captured by this categorical feature. It encompasses various processor types and specifications, with higher-performance CPUs typically resulting in higher laptop prices.

Ram: This categorical feature denotes the Random Access Memory (RAM) capacity of the laptop. RAM size affects the laptop's multitasking capabilities and overall performance, influencing pricing accordingly.

Weight: The weight of the laptop is captured by this numerical feature. Lighter laptops may be more desirable for portability, potentially influencing pricing based on user preferences.

Price: This is the target variable of the prediction model. Representing the laptop's price, this numerical feature is what the prediction model aims to accurately predict based on the other features.

Touchscreen: This feature represents if a laptop has a touchscreen feature embedded in it. It is a categorical column representing 0- not touch screen, 1- touch screen.

Ips: IPS (in-plane switching) is a screen technology for liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). In IPS, a layer of liquid crystals is sandwiched between two glass surfaces. It is a categorical feature which represents whether a laptop has Ips feature or not.

Ppi: Ppi (Pixels Per Inch) is a  measurement of the resolution of a monitor or scanner. It is numerical feature which displays the measure of Ppi. 

Cpu: The Central Processing Unit (CPU) of the laptop is captured by this categorical feature. It encompasses various processor types and specifications, with higher-performance CPUs typically resulting in higher laptop prices.

HDD: A hard drive or hard disk drive (HDD) is a type of data storage device that is used in laptops and desktop computers. It represents the amount of space HDD ofeers in laptops.

SSD: Solid-state drives (SSDs) are the most common storage drives today. SSDs are smaller and faster than hard disk drives (HDDs). It represents the amount of space SSD offers in laptops.

GPU: The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is captured by this categorical feature. It encompasses different GPU configurations, including integrated and dedicated graphics, impacting the laptop's performance in graphics-intensive tasks and potentially affecting pricing.

OpSys: This categorical feature represents the laptop's Operating System. Different operating systems can influence user preferences and software compatibility, thereby impacting the laptop's perceived value and pricing.
